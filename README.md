# Webpage-Testing

Detailed step-by-step instructions on how to set up a HTML webpage using GitHub Pages:

1. Create a GitHub account: If you don't already have a GitHub account, go to github.com and sign up for a free account.

2. Create a new repository: Once you've signed in to your GitHub account, click on the "New" button in the upper-left corner of the screen to create a new repository.

3. Name your repository: Give your repository a name. You can choose any name you like, but it's best to use a name that describes what your website is about.

4. Choose the repository type: Select "Public" or "Private," depending on whether you want your website to be publicly accessible or not. If you choose "Private," you will need to upgrade to a paid GitHub plan.

5. Initialize your repository with a README: Check the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README" to create a README file in your repository.

6. Create an index.html file: Navigate to your repository and click the "Add file" button, then select "Create new file." Name the file "index.html" and add your HTML code to the file.

7. Commit your changes: Once you've added your HTML code, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the "Commit changes" button to save your changes.

8. Go to your repository's settings: Click on the "Settings" tab in your repository.

9. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section: Under the "GitHub Pages" section, select the branch you want to use for your website. Select "main" if you used the default branch, or select "gh-pages" if you created a new branch specifically for your website.

10. Choose a theme (optional): If you want to use a theme for your website, select one of the pre-built themes under the "GitHub Pages" section.

11. Save your changes: Once you've selected your branch and theme (if applicable), click the "Save" button to save your changes.

12. View your website: After you've saved your changes, you should see a green banner at the top of the "Settings" page that says "Your site is ready to be published at [URL]." Click on the URL to view your website.
